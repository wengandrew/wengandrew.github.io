I am actively developing coursework at the masters and professional level on the topic of battery engineering and battery manufacturing process fundamentals. I have also served as Graduate Student Instructor (GSI), guest lecturer, and workshop developer at multiple venues over the past four years.

### Battery Manufacturing Online Short Course (**Fall 2024**)

- Leading course content development from scratch to realize a 6-week intensive course in battery manufacturing process fundamentals; responsibilities include syllabus conceptualization, learner profile development, course content development, evaluation material development, video lecture recordings, online course implementation, and course delivery facilitation.

### ME499/599: Battery Engineering and Lifetime Management (**Fall 2023**)

- Assisted in course content development for a new introductory course on lithium-ion battery physics, lifetime management, and sustainability; the course was launched in Fall 2023 with 47 students enrolled.

### Battery Boot Camp (**Summer 2023**)

- Prepared and delivered three hours of course content for a "train-the-trainers" workshop for local United Auto Workers leaders, community college instructors, and members from the local automotive industry; topics covered battery materials, mining, manufacturing, and recycling.

## Graduate Student Instructor

I served as graduate student instructor (GSI) for ME565: Battery Systems and Control, in Winter 2021. Beyond core responsibilities, I organized extra tutorials on Matlab/Simulink to help students with without a mechanical engineering background catch up on course prerequisites. I also volunteered to update course homework, lecture material, and quizzes, to improve accessibility of course materials for students without a background in controls engineering.

## Guest Lecturer

I have given multiple guest lectures on the topic of battery materials, metals, mining, manufacturing, and and sustainability.

- ME481/599: Manufacturing Process Fundamentals (Fall 2023)
- ME499/599: Battery Engineering and Lifetime Management (Fall 2023)
- ME565: Battery Controls and Modeling (Winter 2022)

## Workshop Developer and Speaker

- American Control Conference (Summer 2022): I developed and presented workshop tutorials on battery manufacturing, battery degradation mechanisms, and physics-based models for battery lifetime, to an audience of controls engineers.
