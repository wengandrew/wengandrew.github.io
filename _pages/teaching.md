## Coursework Development
I develop university-level coursework on battery engineering and battery manufacturing process fundamentals. I have served as a course instructor, guest lecturer, and workshop developer at multiple venues over the past four years.

### Battery Manufacturing Process Fundamentals
I built from scratch the first professional education course in [battery cell manufacturing process fundamentals](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7317534923899236352/) in the U.S. The first cohort included 50 engineers from a major automotive OEM, who gave the course a 95%+ satisfaction rating.

### ME499/599: Battery Engineering and Lifetime Management (**Fall 2023**)
I helped develop course content for a new introductory course on lithium-ion battery physics, lifetime management, and sustainability; the course was launched in Fall 2023 with 47 students enrolled.

## Instructor Experience

### Battery Boot Camp (**Summer 2023**)
I prepared and delivered course content for a "train-the-trainers" workshop for local United Auto Workers (UAW) leaders, community college instructors, and members from the local automotive industry. Topics covered battery materials, mining, manufacturing, and recycling.

### Graduate Student Instructor
I served as graduate student instructor (GSI) for ME565: Battery Systems and Control in Winter 2021. Beyond my core responsibilities, I organized extra tutorials on Matlab/Simulink to help students with without a mechanical engineering background catch up on course prerequisites. I also volunteered to update course homework, lecture material, and quizzes, to improve accessibility of course materials for students without a background in controls engineering.

### Guest Lecturer
I have served as a guest lecturer for topics covering battery materials, metals, mining, manufacturing, and sustainability.
- ME599: Principles, Materials, Manufacturing, and Devices of Batteries (Fall 2024)
- ME481/599: Manufacturing Processes (Fall 2023)
- ME499/599: Battery Engineering and Lifetime Management (Fall 2023)
- ME565: Battery Systems and Control (Winter 2022)

### Workshop Developer and Speaker
At the American Control Conference (Summer 2022), I developed and presented workshop tutorials on battery manufacturing, battery degradation mechanisms, and physics-based models for battery lifetime, to an audience of controls engineers.
