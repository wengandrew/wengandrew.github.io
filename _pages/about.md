I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Battery Control Group at the University of Michigan](https://batterycontrolgroup.engin.umich.edu/). Before that, I was a [Staff Cell Engineer at Tesla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wengandrew/), where I led projects on battery performance evaluation, systems modeling, and in-house 4680 cell development (2013 to 2024). My training blends elements from dynamic systems modeling, control theory, electrochemical engineering, software engineering, and materials characterization.

My current research focuses on **energy storage systems modeling** with an emphasis on battery manufacturing process optimization and lifetime prediction. My mission is to **build a knowledge base enabling new battery manufacturing technologies to be deployed rapidly, at scale, and sustainably**. I am also passionate about battery workforce development and have led research efforts to quantify labor productivity shifts due to the EV transition.

I am actively involved a few projects at the moment:
- [_University of Michigan Electric Vehicle Center_](https://evc.engin.umich.edu/): Leading coursework development and delivery for a new online professional course in [Battery Cell Manufacturing, Testing and Design](https://ope.engin.umich.edu/pe/battery-cell-mfg/) ([Syllabus](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B8HrqR4hT7gCjsoQ0Km4vr9cxTF3NXKT/view?usp=share_link), [Reviews](https://drive.google.com/file/d/181GwyG82C9dsn5IWwRERM8qOkwtLN7jg/view?usp=share_link)); advancing research in battery manufacturing diagnostics and control.
- [_University of South Carolina, Chemical Engineering_](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/engineering_and_computing/news_events/news/2022/dougal_10_million_navy_research.php): Advancing research in battery digital twin technologies for power and energy system applications.
- [_Volta Foundation_](https://volta.foundation/battery-report): Serving as Program Director for the [Battery Talent Census](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5446555): the largest, most comprehensive data collection initiative focused on workforce trends, compensation, and talent gaps within the battery ecosystem.
