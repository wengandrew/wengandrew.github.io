I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Battery Control Group at the University of Michigan](https://batterycontrolgroup.engin.umich.edu/). Before that, I was a [Staff Cell Engineer at Tesla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wengandrew/), where I focused on battery performance evaluation, degradation analysis, systems modeling, and in-house 4680 cell development (2013 to 2024). My training blends elements from mechanical engineering (dynamic systems modeling and control theory), computer science (computing systems and AI/ML), and materials science (characterization methods).

My research focuses on **energy systems modeling** with an emphasis on battery manufacturing process optimization, battery lifetime prediction, and battery workforce development. My mission is to **build a knowledge base enabling new battery manufacturing technologies to be deployed rapidly, at scale, and with sustainability in mind**.

I also currently hold joint appointments with the following organizations:
- [_University of Michigan Electric Vehicle Center_](https://evc.engin.umich.edu/): Lead Coursework Developer and Instructor for the EV Masters Program to be launched in Fall 2025
- [_University of South Carolina, Chemical Engineering_](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/engineering_and_computing/news_events/news/2022/dougal_10_million_navy_research.php): Project Engineer for developing battery digital twin technology in naval power and energy systems 
- [_Volta Foundation_](https://volta.foundation/battery-report): Content Lead for the Annual Battery Report: Talent and Workforce Development

## Working Together

I am firmly committed to collaborating across disciplines and institutions. Currently ongoing collaborations include:

- Gabriel Ehrlich, *University of Michigan, Department of Economics*: effect of the electric vehicle transition on vehicle assembly labor intensity
- Nicolas Rolston, *Arizona State University, School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering*: sodium-ion cell performance at low temperatures
- Ralph E. White and Paul T. Coman, *University of South Carolina, Chemical Engineering*: electrochemical modeling and battery safety
- Peter M. Attia, *Glimpse, Inc.* and *Stanford University*: battery lifetime prediction from manufacturing data and battery mechanical failure mode understanding
- Weihan Li, *Aachen University*: accelerated test design for battery lifetime evaluation

I would love to hear from you! Please write me an email if you'd like to start a conversation about research ideas. My email is "asweng [at] umich [dot] edu".
