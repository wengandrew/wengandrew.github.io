I am a **Postdoctoral Fellow** in the [**Battery Control Group at the University of Michigan**](https://batterycontrolgroup.engin.umich.edu/). Before that, I was a [**Staff Cell Engineer at Tesla**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wengandrew/), where I focused on battery technology evaluation and battery systems modeling (2013 to 2024). My educational training blends mechanical engineering, materials science, and computer science.

My research focuses on **energy systems modeling** with an emphasis on battery manufacturing process optimization, battery lifetime prediction, and battery workforce development. 

My mission is to **build a knowledge base enabling new battery manufacturing technologies to be deployed rapidly and sustainably**.

I also currently hold joint appointments with the following organizations:
- [_University of Michigan Electric Vehicle Center_](https://evc.engin.umich.edu/): **Lead Coursework Developer and Instructor** for the EV Masters Program to be launched in Fall 2025
- [_University of South Carolina, Chemical Engineering_](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/engineering_and_computing/news_events/news/2022/dougal_10_million_navy_research.php): **Project Engineer** for battery digital twins in naval power and energy systems 
- [_Volta Foundation_](https://volta.foundation/battery-report): **Content Lead** for the Annual Battery Report: Talent and Workforce Development

## Working Together

I am firmly committed to collaborating across disciplines and institutions. My ongoing collaborations include:

- Gabriel Ehrlich, *University of Michigan, Department of Economics*: effect of the electric vehicle transition on vehicle assembly labor intensity
- Nicolas Rolston, *Arizona State University, School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering*: sodium-ion cell performance at low temperatures
- Ralph E. White and Paul T. Coman, *University of South Carolina, Chemical Engineering*: electrochemical modeling and battery safety
- Peter M. Attia, *Glimpse, Inc.* and *Stanford University*: battery lifetime prediction from manufacturing data and battery mechanical failure mode understanding
- Weihan Li, *Aachen University*: accelerated test design for battery lifetime evaluation

I would love to hear from you! Please write me an email if you'd like to start a conversation about research ideas. My email is "asweng [at] umich [dot] edu".
