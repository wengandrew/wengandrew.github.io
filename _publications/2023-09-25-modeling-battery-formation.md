excerpt: 'This work bridges the gap between electrochemical descriptions of SEI growth and applications toward improving industrial battery manufacturing process control where battery formation is an essential but time-consuming final step. We envision that the formation model can be used to predict the impact of formation protocols and electrolyte systems on SEI passivation and resulting battery lifetime.'

This work bridges the gap between electrochemical descriptions of SEI growth and applications toward improving industrial battery manufacturing process control where battery formation is an essential but time-consuming final step. We envision that the formation model can be used to predict the impact of formation protocols and electrolyte systems on SEI passivation and resulting battery lifetime.
