permalink: /publication/2023-03-22-differential-voltage
excerpt: 'We present a method for collecting and analyzing full cell near-equilibrium voltage curves for end-of-line manufacturing process control. The method builds on existing literature on differential voltage analysis (DVA or dV/dQ) by expanding the method formalism through the lens of reproducibility, interpretability, and automation. Our model revisions introduce several new derived metrics relevant to manufacturing process control, including lithium consumed during formation and the practical negative-to-positive ratio, which complement standard metrics such as positive and negative electrode capacities. To facilitate method reproducibility, we reformulate the model to account for the “inaccessible lithium problem” which quantifies the numerical differences between modeled versus true values for electrode capacities and stoichiometries. We finally outline key data collection considerations, including C-rate and charging direction for both full cell and half cell datasets, which may impact method reproducibility. This work highlights the opportunities for leveraging voltage-based electrochemical metrics for online battery manufacturing process control.'

We present a method for collecting and analyzing full cell near-equilibrium voltage curves for end-of-line manufacturing process control. The method builds on existing literature on differential voltage analysis (DVA or dV/dQ) by expanding the method formalism through the lens of reproducibility, interpretability, and automation. Our model revisions introduce several new derived metrics relevant to manufacturing process control, including lithium consumed during formation and the practical negative-to-positive ratio, which complement standard metrics such as positive and negative electrode capacities. To facilitate method reproducibility, we reformulate the model to account for the “inaccessible lithium problem” which quantifies the numerical differences between modeled versus true values for electrode capacities and stoichiometries. We finally outline key data collection considerations, including C-rate and charging direction for both full cell and half cell datasets, which may impact method reproducibility.
